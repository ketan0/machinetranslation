Bayesian machine translation project I created in 2016. Refer to smtinfosheet for the info on how this project functions. Model was trained on a Europarl corpus containing side-by-side transcripts of UN proceedings in German and English. In order to run this project, download the pre-trained models from [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10ZZ6L2dE-Cgl6onc1wOZHAgT2GLTvxDQ?usp=sharing) and place them in the same folder as the code files for this project.
